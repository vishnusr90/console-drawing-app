# A simple console drawing application

## Steps to start application
 - Import the code in visual code or any other IDE
 - Import the dependencies (pom.xml)
 - Start the application (F5)

## Features/ Assumptions
 - Canvas has to be created first before we can add any line/rectangle or bucket fill
 - Only horizontal and vertical lines can be created
 - Only lines within the canvas boundary can be drawn
 - Commands are sanitized before implementing (handling of extra spaces at the front and back)
 - Detailed test cases have been written
